# Linux with LLFree

In addition to the general dependencies rust `nightly` version `1.64.0` (or newer) is needed.
> Rustup is recommended: [install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)

First enable the `CONFIG_LLFREE` and `CONFIG_LLFREE_FAST_FREE` options (`make LLVM=1 menuconfig`). It is currently limited to x86_64.
Then the Kernel can be build as usual (with llvm):

```sh
make O=build-llfree-vm LLVM=1 #...
```

## Structure

The llfree module can be found in [mm/llfree](mm/llfree).
It consists of a rust library that uses the [llfree-rs](https://scm.sra.uni-hannover.de/research/llfree-rs) crate and a c wrapper.

## Problems

- Please increase `KSYM_NAME_LEN` both in kernel and kallsyms.c
- Non-allocatable sections: .llvmbc, .llvmcmd
- Unknown sections: .text.__rust_probestack, .eh_frame

## Support for printk

The exported function `rust_fmt_argument` is a custom formatter for the rust print formatting.
It has to be called in `lib/vsprintf.c:pointer` for the `%pA` format argument:

```c
char *pointer(const char *fmt, char *buf, char *end, void *ptr,
	      struct printf_spec spec)
{
    switch(*fmt) {
// ...
    case 'A':
        return rust_fmt_argument(buf, end, ptr);
// ...
    }
}
```

> Logging is automatically initialized with the allocator.
